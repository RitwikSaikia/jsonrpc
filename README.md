## JsonRpc ##

JSON-RPC is a Java library implementing a very light weight client/server functionality of JSON-RPC protocol.
Server/Client API is designed in such a way that, you don't have to worry about the details of the protocol.
Just register the implementation classes in the server side, and create remote proxy objects at the client sides on the fly.

The API works well in **Android/Google App Engine/Javascript** applications.
